## Blog List Exercises Front End

#### 5.1 - 5.4

I decided to write the front end myself without cloning the application, for more challenge. I used my backend from Part 4. If user is not logged in, only login form is visible. If logged in, the blogs are shown, along with UI. Login is 'permanent' with local storage. Logged in user can add new blogs. Implemented notifications to inform user of status of operations.
